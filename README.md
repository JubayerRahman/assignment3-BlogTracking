# Blog Management website

This is a blog management website I made with 
- Typsscript
- express
- node
- JWT
- MongoDB

To be honest before this assignment I used to hate JWT, But now I am confident I can make a teken with any data I want and also middle ware. So lets disscuss what services this server provide us.

### Here are them:
- Create users (User and Admin)
- Login Feature with token (different tokens for users and admin but the process is same)
- create blogs (Users can create blogs)
- Update Blogs (users can Update their own blogs)
- users can also delte their blogs
- An admin can do all the things but also can can block any users they want 
- An admin can delete any blog they want (its their super power)

## How to use this project into your local mechine?
- Clone this repo
- open it in vscode and them in the terminal write ```npm i``` it will install all the necessary libraries for the project.
- then create a ```.env``` file to add the database link
